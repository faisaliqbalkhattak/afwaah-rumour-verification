# Afwaah — آفواہ

> **A decentralized, anonymous campus rumor verification system.**  
> No server. No admin. No identity leakage. Just math deciding what's true.

Afwaah (Urdu for *rumor*) is a peer-to-peer infrastructure where students post and verify campus rumors anonymously. Every device is a node. Truth is determined not by who shouts loudest, but by **Bayesian game theory** — a mechanism where lying is mathematically unprofitable.

Built in the NUST Olympiad Hackathon.

## How It Works

![System Workflow](images/workflow.png)

Students verify their university identity once using a `.eml` file from their inbox. A **zero-knowledge proof** is generated — proving they're a real student without revealing *who* they are. From that point on, every vote and post is anonymous but accountable.

Rumors are scored not by popularity, but by **Bayesian Truth Serum** — an information-theoretic mechanism where informed minorities can outweigh uninformed majorities. Bot clusters are detected and neutralized. Deleted rumors leave no trace.

## The Problem It Solves

Campus information travels fast and is often wrong. Existing solutions either require a central authority to decide what's true (a single point of failure and censorship), or they let popularity win (mobs can spread false narratives). Afwaah solves both.

| Challenge | Solution |
|---|---|
| Anonymous posting without identity leakage | Semaphore ZK proofs + nullifier hashes |
| No central truth authority | BTS scoring — math decides, not admins |
| Preventing double votes without collecting identities | Poseidon nullifiers: deterministic per (identity, rumor) pair |
| Popular lies winning | BTS rewards *surprisingly common* answers, not *majority* answers |
| Bot accounts flooding votes | Pearson correlation clustering — bots in lockstep lose 91% of their weight |
| Deleted rumors haunting scores | 2-pass tombstone rebuild — removed rumors are completely erased from state |
| Score manipulation over time | Append-only OpLog — past state is cryptographically immutable |

## Tech Stack

**Identity & Privacy**
- [Semaphore Protocol](https://semaphore.pse.dev/) — ZK group membership proofs
- ZK-Email / DKIM — cryptographic university email verification


**Truth Scoring**
- Bayesian Truth Serum (Prelec, 2004) — incentive-compatible voting for N ≥ 30
- Robust BTS with peer-pairing — handles small populations (N ≥ 3)
- Personalized PageRank — weights votes by historical accuracy, not just quantity

**Sybil & Bot Resistance**
- Pearson correlation clustering (Union-Find) — detects accounts voting in lockstep
- Correlation dampener — bot clusters reduced to ~1/11th effective weight
- Group slash — coordinated attackers penalized at `O(log k)` scale

**Network & Storage**
- [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/) — encrypted P2P transport (Noise protocol)
- GossipSub — topic-based message propagation
- Kademlia DHT — distributed peer discovery
- mDNS — local network (campus WiFi) peer discovery
- OrbitDB / IPFS — distributed append-only log

**Backend**
- Node.js ≥ 18

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js ≥ 18.0.0
- npm ≥ 9.0.0

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/faisaliqbalkhattak/afwaah-rumour-verification.git
cd afwaah-rumour-verification/backend

```

**216 tests. 4 suites. All passing.**

| Suite | Tests |
|---|---|
| Identity (DKIM, Semaphore, Merkle tree) | 37 |
| Scoring (BTS, RBTS, correlation, reputation, PPR) | 95 |
| Network (libp2p, GossipSub, anti-entropy sync) | 41 |
| Integration (full flow, tombstones, snapshotter) | 43 |
| **Total** | **216** |

## Using ZK Email Verification

To join the anonymous group, you prove ownership of a university email without revealing the address. This requires a `.eml` file.

**Getting a `.eml` from Gmail:**
1. Open any email from your university inbox 
2. The Inbox should be in allowed domains see under ["backend\src\config.js"](backend/src/config.js)
3. Add your desired domian there then go to next step
4. Click the three-dot menu → **"Download message"**
5. Upload the downloaded `.eml` file to Afwaah
6. Select the "Verify Identity" option in the app.

The system verifies the DKIM cryptographic signature in the email (fetching the RSA public key directly from your university's DNS), confirms the signing domain is a known university domain, and checks the `Delivered-To` header to confirm it reached your inbox — all without ever storing or verifying your email address.

### Configuring Allowed Domains

```javascript
// backend/src/config.js
export const IDENTITY = {
  ALLOWED_DOMAINS: ['seecs.edu.pk', 'your-university.edu'],
};
```

NOTE: If any link or path (local: those pointing internally to the project files) is not working the issue will be that windows path are not compatable with linux. The paths I have used are Windows compatable.
